    <p>Delicious chocolate chip cookies</p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    These were fantastic cookies, without a doubt. 
    I did lessen the white sugar to 1/2 cup and increase the brown sugar to 1 1/2 
    cups for a richer flavor.
     I also recommend using Trader Joe's Vanilla Paste, but that's just a preference. 
     However, if you want the perfect cookie, be sure to chill your dough for at least an 
     hour 
     (2 hours is better) and they will come out even. I baked at 325 for about 12 minutes. 
     On Silpat or parchment paper, they'll turn out fabulous every time. 
    I am sending them to work with my fiance to keep me from eating three dozen of them! :)
