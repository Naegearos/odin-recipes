    Time consuming but it is well worth it! 
    The brown sugar and bacon grease combine beautifully and give such a great taste.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sliced bacon, cut into thirds</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package beef cocktail wieners </li>
        <li>Â¾ cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Refrigerate 2/3 of the bacon until needed. 
            It is easier to wrap the wieners with cold bacon. 
            Wrap each cocktail wiener with a piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick. 
            Place on a large baking sheet. 
            Sprinkle brown sugar generously over all.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sugar is bubbly. 
            To serve, place the wieners in a slow cooker and keep on the low setting.</li>
    </ol>
